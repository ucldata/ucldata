        <p>Welcome to the Data Science Curriculum - UCL's student-led machine learning workshop series. Throughout the academic year, we'll bring you 8 fully fledged, 2-hour workshops sessions where you'll learn everything from coding in R or Python, statistical thinking, and advanced machine learning algorithms.</p>
        <p>
          In this workshop you can expect to look at supervised learning for classification problems. We'll introduce more models, such as decision trees and support vector machines, as well as discussing model selection and assessment.
